                                Wienerberger launches new integrated solar range
                            </h3>
                            <h6>Wienerberger UK and Ireland is excited to launch ‘Sandtoft in-roof Solar’, a brand-new roof
                                tile which providing housebuilders with a seamlessly integrated solar energy source, helping
                                them meet the requirements of recent Part L legislation and future-proofing new homes for
                                the Future Homes Standard 2025.</h6>
                            <p class="text-justify" style="line-height: 1.2;">In a significant move for the manufacturer,
                                the new Sandtoft In-Roof Solar product will build on Wienerberger’s existing portfolio of
                                concrete and clay tiles. When offered alongside the company’s range of brick, block, and
                                façade systems, this uniquely positions Wienerberger to provide solutions for the full
                                building envelope through both Fabric and Technology options, with a combination of these
                                helping housebuilders to meet their energy efficiency and carbon reduction targets.

                                Keith Barker, managing director of Wienerberger UK and Ireland, said: “This is a huge step
                                for us as we boost our support to housebuilders, helping the sector to prepare for a net
                                zero future. Building regulations and the Future Homes Standard lead to homes which can
                                generate and store their own energy - Solar is the most efficient way to achieve this. As a
                                sustainable manufacturer, we are committed to innovating for the future, and this means
                                developing new customer offerings that reduce our impact on the planet.” <br>

                                Sandtoft in-roof Solar will be delivered via a partnership with Oxford-based Westech Solar,
                                a progressive renewable technologies business. Jenny Chen, Founder and Director at Westech,
                                added: “We’re delighted to be partnering with a manufacturer who shares our commitment to
                                delivering sustainable solutions for the built environment and, by working with
                                Wienerberger, we will be able to deliver solar at scale through Wienerberger’s established
                                route to market. This partnership will give housebuilders an easy-to-install and sustainable
                                solution to support them with the changes that lie ahead.”

                                <br>The in-roof integrated panels are applied directly to the roof battens, incorporating an
                                interlocking design to speed up the installation process. The single-lapped panels have also
                                been developed to reflect the aesthetic of a traditional tiled roof and are fully compatible
                                with all clay and concrete tiles. Furthermore, when used in combination with Sandtoft roof
                                tiles and accessories through our “RoofSpec” design & specification service, customers will
                                benefit from a 15-year system warranty. <br>

                                The product will be available from February 2023 through major merchants and direct to
                                Wienerberger’s housebuilder customers across the UK and Ireland.
